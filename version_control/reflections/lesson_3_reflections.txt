Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  If you pull, you specify that you want to pull a specific branch for a remote repository.  If there are no differences between the local and remote repo, then you're fine. 
  However, if they are different, this could lead to inconsistencies.  You may not want to pull.  Let's also consider collaboration.  If someone else is pushing, you may be working on a feature that could be affected.
